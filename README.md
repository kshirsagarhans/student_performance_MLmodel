# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** to predict student performance based on various academic and demographic factors. The goal is to identify students at risk and understand key influences on their performance, enabling educators to take proactive measures.  

The model is trained on historical student data, analyzing features such as **study time, attendance, previous grades, parental education, and more** to predict final academic outcomes. Additionally, a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** is integrated to analyze sequential patterns in student performance over time.

 **Machine Learning Models** – Training models like **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost** for prediction  
 **Model Evaluation** – Assessing performance using **R² score, MAE, RMSE**  
 **Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Integration** – Sequential analysis for predicting student risk levels  
 **Feature Importance Analysis** – Identifying the most impactful factors affecting student success
